        <u><h3>Who is Dylan Quach?</h3></u>
        <p>Hello! If you're looking at this then I'm either presenting or showing this against my will! Either way, let's get down to it. My name's Dylan Quach, a first generation Vietnamese-American living in South Jordan, Utah. My Parents went on a boat looking to reach the greatest country in the world, but ended up in America instead. This is my story. But it's kind of a work in progress soooooooo...</p>

        <p id="Background">
         <u><h3>Background</h3></u>
         I'm a 17 Year old Vietnamese American currently living in South Jordan Utah
         I live with my two parents and my younger sister. Currently, I'm attending 
         Itineris Early College High School as a senior. I'm taking concurrent and Early
         Enrollment classes so I can get my associates by the time I graduate high school.
         I'm currently part of extra-curricular groups such as National Honors Society, HOSA,
         Future Buisness Leaders of America, and an after school program called FIND, where I can 
         learn to code, program, and creates designs for the future.     
        </p>

        <p id="Hobbies and Pasttimes">
            <u><h3>Hobbies and Pasttimes</h3></u>
            With my schoolwork and club participation, I have no
            more time to do anything outside of school! But before
            my free time was utterly erraticated, I used to do a bunch of 
            fun stuff and activities to bid my time. I used to do things like:
            <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
            <li>Playing Guitar and Writing Music</li>
            <li>Playing Video Games</li>
            <li>Taking care of Younger Kids</li>
            <li>Hiking</li>
            <li>Cooking</li>
            <li>Making Games</li>
            <li>Martial Arts</li>
            <li>Contemplating that my life is just decades of hard work and struggle that will ultimately end in my death, devastating those around me from either old age or suicide, leading to the ultimate sadness of those I cared about. Until their emotions eventually lead to numbness as my memory is lost to time. Eventually making it so that my life is nothing but a speck in the history, only to be brushed aside and forgotten. </li>
            <li>Bowling</li>
            </ul>
            Although I don't have time to do most of these things anymore, I still make time when I can to enjoy and hate myself
            in this vicious and delicate cycle of life.
        </p>

        <p id="Clubs and Associations">
            <u><h3>Clubs and Associations</h3></u>
            Although I have a lot to do in school, I still use a 
            lot of my time to participate in charity, clubs, and 
            programs after school. Ranging from Health Science to Computer Science, I always try to keep myself busy afterschool. 
            I take part in things like:
            <ul>
                <li>National Honors Society</li>
                <li>Future Buisness Leaders of America</li>
                <li>HOSA</li>
                <li>Future in Design</li>
                <li>Obssessive Crying</li>
                <li>and more!...</li>
            </ul>
            I also participate in service and charity while I still can. My hopes are that
            I can earn scholarships and gain experience through all of these things.
            Also I usually don't have anything better to do. Soooooooooooo...

        <!--"Dreams to Be Broken" Paragraph Starts-->
        <p id="Dreams to be Broken">
            <u><h3>Dreams to be Broken</h3></u>
            Young and ambitious, I have plenty of dreams that I'm waiting to be 
            shattered before my very eyes. For days, weeks, months, years, I've been
            working to get far enough in life to be barely satisfied with the progress 
            I've gotten done, to the point where my mediocre lifestyle can crumble right before my very eyes.
            Luckily, I'm ready.
            With a large set of unhealthy cry foods and a small support group, I can be ready to 
            break down like never before. I want to go to school in UCLA, so I can get a degree in 
            computer science and buisness. Afterwards, I hope I can create my own programming company, to raise 
            money to develop new technologies that can help third world countries. Now, I'm just waiting for all of
            these dreams to crash. Before I know it, I'll be living in a dead end job with nothing but a small check
            and regrets.
        </p>
